# Daisy_Llusion
A game project in Lua on Pico-8 from my certification at Ada Tech School.

A good way to discover Lua language and the Pico-8 universe.

Pitch (Peach ?):
Step into the shoes of Daisy and try with all your might to overcome the difficulties that await you to save the one you love: Mario.
Hoping that your prince charming is on the same wavelength...

Pico-8 version : 0.2.5c
